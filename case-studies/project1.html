    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            EduPay is a comprehensive payment platform designed to streamline school-related transactions for Kenyan parents. 
            The project involved creating three interconnected experiences: a parent mobile app, parent web portal, and admin dashboard.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            <strong>I was responsible for designing the Admin Web Dashboard</strong>, which enables school administrators to manage student accounts, 
            track payments, generate reports, and communicate with parents. I collaborated with two other designers who handled the parent-facing 
            mobile and web experiences, ensuring design consistency across the entire ecosystem.

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            While parents struggled with fragmented payment channels, <strong>school administrators faced an equally challenging problem</strong>: 
            managing hundreds of transactions across multiple payment types, reconciling accounts, generating reports for accountability, 
            and keeping parents informed about payment statuses - all while using disconnected spreadsheets and manual processes.
        </p>

        <div class="key-stats">
            <div class="stat">
                <span class="stat-number">10+</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Hours Weekly on Reconciliation</span>
            </div>
            <div class="stat">

            </div>
            <div class="stat">

                <span class="stat-label">Manual Data Entry</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <strong>Admin Dashboard Goal:</strong> Create a centralized system for school administrators to efficiently manage student accounts, 
            track all payment activities in real-time, generate financial reports, and communicate payment statuses to parents - eliminating manual processes 
            and reducing administrative burden.

    <!-- RESEARCH -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Our Product Manager conducted in-depth user research with Kenyan schools and administrators to understand their pain points 
            and needs. Here are the key insights that informed our design decisions:
        </p>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Admin Insight #1</h4>
                <p>Administrators spent 10+ hours weekly manually reconciling payments from different channels (M-Pesa, bank transfers, cash).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Admin Insight #2</h4>
                <p>Generating financial reports for the board required days of manual Excel work, causing delays in decision-making.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Admin Insight #3</h4>
                <p>No easy way to track which students had outstanding balances or send payment reminders to parents at scale.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Admin Insight #4</h4>
                <p>Admins needed different permission levels for bursar, accountant, and principal roles - but most systems were all-or-nothing.</p>

        <h2>User Journey & Flows</h2>
        <p>
            I mapped out the key administrator journeys in FigJam, focusing on the most frequent tasks: processing payments, 
            managing student accounts, and generating reports. The goal was to minimize clicks while maintaining data accuracy.

            <strong>Design Process:</strong> I started with hand-drawn wireframes to quickly explore different layout options

        <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
            <h4>Dashboard Overview with Actionable Insights</h4>
            <p>Designed a data-rich dashboard that immediately shows key metrics: total revenue, pending payments, overdue accounts, and recent transactions. 
            Each metric is clickable, allowing admins to dive deeper into specific areas that need attention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-box">
            <h4>Advanced Search & Filtering System</h4>
            <p>Created a powerful search interface that lets admins quickly find students by name, ID, class, or payment status. 
            Added bulk actions for common tasks like sending payment reminders or generating receipts for multiple students.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-box">
            <h4>Role-Based Permissions & Access Control</h4>
            <p>Implemented a flexible permission system where different admin roles (Bursar, Accountant, Principal) see different views and have 
            different action capabilities. This addresses the security concerns raised in research while maintaining workflow efficiency.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-box">
            <h4>One-Click Report Generation</h4>
            <p>Designed a report builder that generates common financial reports (monthly revenue, outstanding balances, payment trends) with a single click. 
            Admins can customize date ranges and export in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-box">
            <h4>Real-Time Payment Tracking & Notifications</h4>
            <p>Added a live transaction feed showing payments as they come in from M-Pesa, bank transfers, or the parent app. 
            Automatic reconciliation reduces manual data entry by 85%.</p>

        <p>
            The EduPay platform is currently in development, with designs being implemented by the engineering team.

    <!-- LEARNINGS -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>
            This project taught me the importance of designing for trust in financial applications. Every micro-interaction, 
            every confirmation message, and every piece of visual feedback contributes to the user's confidence in the system.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            Working in a collaborative design team also reinforced the value of maintaining a unified design language while 
            allowing individual designers autonomy over their respective platforms.
