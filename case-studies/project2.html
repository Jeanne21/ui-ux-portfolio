    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            EduPay is a comprehensive payment platform designed to streamline school-related transactions for Kenyan parents. 
            The project involved creating three interconnected experiences: a parent mobile app, parent web portal, and admin dashboard. 
            I was responsible for designing the <strong>admin dashboard</strong>, working collaboratively with two other designers 
            on the complete ecosystem.

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Kenyan parents struggle with fragmented payment channels when managing their children's school expenses. 
            Fees, meals, uniforms, trips, and exams all require separate transactions through different systems, 
            leading to lost receipts, unclear payment histories, and frustration.
        </p>

        <div class="key-stats">
            <div class="stat">
                <span class="stat-number">5+</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Different Payment Channels</span>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <strong>Design Goal:</strong> Create a single, transparent platform that consolidates all school payments 
            while providing clear transaction history and real-time payment tracking.

    <!-- RESEARCH -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Our Product Manager conducted in-depth user research with 15+ Kenyan parents to understand their pain points 
            and needs. Here are the key insights that informed our design decisions:
        </p>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Key Insight #1</h4>
                <p>Parents wanted a clear breakdown of where their money goes, with itemized receipts for each payment type.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Key Insight #2</h4>
                <p>Trust was a major concern - parents needed confirmation that payments actually reached the school.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Key Insight #3</h4>
                <p>Mobile-first was essential - most parents managed finances on-the-go during work hours.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>💡 Key Insight #4</h4>
                <p>Parents with multiple children needed easy account switching and consolidated views.</p>

            I mapped out the key user journeys in FigJam, focusing on making payment flows as intuitive as possible

            <strong>Design Process:</strong> I started with hand-drawn wireframes to quickly explore different layout options

            The EduPay platform is currently in development, with designs being implemented by the engineering team. 
            Early stakeholder feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly regarding:

    <!-- LEARNINGS -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>
            This project taught me the importance of designing for trust in financial applications. Every micro-interaction, 
            every confirmation message, and every piece of visual feedback contributes to the user's confidence in the system.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            Working in a collaborative design team also reinforced the value of maintaining a unified design language while 
            allowing individual designers autonomy over their respective platforms.
